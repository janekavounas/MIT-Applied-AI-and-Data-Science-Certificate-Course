This is my portfolio for all the projects I will be doing during my Applied AI and Data Science Certificate Course at MIT. Please follow along as I better my data science skills!

Project 1 Takeaways: We were given a fake company called "FoodHub" to analyze. We were also given the choice between Low Code and Full Code. Since I'm more interested in how to create reports, I chose the full code option. After this project, I noticed I need to work more on data insights (i.e. what is the data showing us, what variables should we compare, etc.) because my analytical skills are much stronger.
